# Deployment to GitHub Pages - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Been Fixed
1. ✅ Search bar properly aligned with sort dropdowns
2. ✅ Added deployment script to package.json
3. ✅ All development files will be backed up to DEVELOPMENT folder
4. ✅ Deploy script ready to use

## Quick Deploy

### Step 1: Run the Deploy Script
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the project
- Backup all development files to `DEVELOPMENT` folder
- Copy dist contents to root for GitHub Pages
- Create necessary files (.nojekyll)

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings**
3. Go to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

Your site will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name
```

## Development Workflow

### To Continue Development After Deployment

If you need to work on the code after deploying:

1. **Restore development files from DEVELOPMENT folder:**
   - Copy files back from DEVELOPMENT folder to root
   - Or keep them in DEVELOPMENT and work there

2. **Make changes and deploy again:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

## File Structure After Deploy

```
Repository Root (GitHub Pages):
├── index.html          (from dist)
├── assets/            (from dist)
├── README_DEPLOY.md
├── .nojekyll
├── package.json       (kept for reference)
├── package-lock.json  (kept for reference)
├── backend/           (backend code - kept)
└── DEVELOPMENT/       (development files - backed up)
    ├── App.vue
    ├── main.js
    ├── style.css
    ├── index.html
    ├── vite.config.js
    └── ... (all dev files)

Development Folder:
├── All your source files
├── All your markdown docs
└── All configuration files
```

## Important Notes

- ✅ Development files are NOT lost - they're in DEVELOPMENT folder
- ✅ The deployed site only contains production files from dist
- ✅ You can continue development anytime
- ✅ Backend code is kept in the backend folder

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deploy script fails
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### Issue: GitHub Pages shows blank page
1. Check if index.html is in root
2. Check if assets folder exists
3. Make sure .nojekyll file is present
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Styles not loading
- Clear browser cache
- Make sure all files from dist are in root

## Alternative: Keep Development Files in Root

If you want to keep development files in the root instead of moving them:

1. **Don't run the deploy script**
2. **Just build and push dist folder:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   git add dist
   git commit -m "Build for GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

Then configure GitHub Pages to serve from `/dist` directory.

## Summary

- ✅ Search bar and dropdowns are now properly aligned
- ✅ Deploy script ready: `npm run deploy`
- ✅ All files backed up to DEVELOPMENT folder
- ✅ Ready for GitHub Pages deployment

Just run `npm run deploy` and push to GitHub!
